# ====== Purpose =======
#
# This test verifies that DROP for a temporary table created
# in Row mode is not logged in binlog at session disconnect.
#
# ====== Implementation ======
#
# Create temporary tables in Row mode using different engines,
# also create a temporary table in Statement mode, now when you connect to the session
# after a disconnect print the output of show binlog events.
# This will verify that the DROP for temporary table created in statement
# mode is written to binary log at session disconnect, but for  the temporary table
# created in Row mode no DROP statement for temporary table is logged at session
# disconnect.

# The name of this file has row_mix even though we are just testing in row
# format because we want the name of tests to be consistent in 5.7 and 8.0
